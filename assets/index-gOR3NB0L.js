It is **not intended for beginners** as it delves deep into the rabbit hole straight from the introduction chapters, with the intent of breaking the common misconceptions and bad practices. 

The first edition has been published quite a while ago, and it's currently being rewritten for a second one to include most recent ecmascript updates and generic revisions. Its main author is **Kyle Simpson**, a somewhat provocative character but very savvy and passionate on what he's talking about.

My favourite of his video series is the one about neural networks from his book "The Nature of Code", where he explains how machine learning works through a very grounded and easy to follow approach, creating a neural network with just bare JavaScript without any libraries, and later implementing his trained models for different use-cases.
