{"name":"Parallel Traveller: Demo","short_name":"Parallel Traveller","description":"A journey through parallel dimensions. One far too big attempt to create a multiverse of scrapped games. It is a very polished demo by my standard (I've put way too much effort in the spriting and small details) but the scope for this game was too fuzzy and so I've decided to pause it (probably forever...). Probably even bigger than 'Dungeons' in terms of projected project size. I've learned a lot of things, and made polishments to the map editor thanks to this game. Keeping track of game events, designing save files, and boss fight design have been fun to develop.","instructions":"Move with <kbd>A</kbd>,<kbd>D</kbd>, jump with <kbd>W</kbd>, interact with <kbd>E</kbd>. When on skateboard, hold <kbd>W</kbd> to jump higher.","thumbnail":"./thumbnail.png","start_url":"./index.html","width":"960","height":"576","links":[{"url":"https://saantonandre.itch.io/parallel-traveller-demo","name":"https://saantonandre.itch.io/parallel-traveller-demo"}],"resources":[],"creation_date":"2021-02-10","desktop":true,"mobile":false}
