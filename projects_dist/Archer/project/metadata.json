{"name":"Archanter","short_name":"Archanter","description":"I was aiming to make a big project out of this but suddenly lost its code because of hard drive problems, but it didn't feel like a big deal because it felt directionless. It helped me brainstorm a lot about roguelikes, and made me more prepared for a biggest vision like Dungeons (which is -to this day- still abandoned by the way).\n\nFor the arrow projectiles I studied and applied ray tracing which is now an available feature on my engine/physics library for future projects.","instructions":"Move with <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> , shoot an arrow with <kbd>Mouse 1</kbd> and melee attack/dash with <kbd>Mouse 2</kbd>.\n\nPress <kbd>2</kbd> to shoot multiple arrows at once and keep pressing to spam arrow (this was more of a stress testing feature)\n\n**Arrow mechanics**: What I came up for the main mechanic is the arrow reloading, you will run out of arrow if you shoot too fast which will act as a sort of forced resource management system. Some arrows will critically strike, and you will see which will crit in advance (pink => critical arrow), they will deal additional damage (to nothing because there are no enemies besides annoying moles) and have an area of effect.","creation_date":"2020-06-30","thumbnail":"./thumbnail.png","start_url":"./index.html","width":"800","height":"600","links":[],"resources":["./laserAlg.png"],"desktop":true,"mobile":false}
