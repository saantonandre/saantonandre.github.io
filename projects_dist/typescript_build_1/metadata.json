{"name":"Rendering experiment v1","short_name":"Rendering experiment v1","description":"First experiment on a kind of unconventional rendering.\n\nThis kind of rendering consists in layering the character, and each layer will move and rotate relatively to the upper layer, with a bigger delay deeper down the layers.\n\nThe advantage in this kind of rendering (other than looking cool) is a reduced amount of assets needed for animations, but what I found to be a big turn off was that I couldn't think of a simple way to render moving legs.
