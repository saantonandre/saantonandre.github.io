{"name":"Dungeons","short_name":"Dungeons","description":"One of my largest projects. The general idea was to have a procedurally generated roguelike environment. I've had a lot of fun developing an algortithm for the maze-like world generation. Among the major features there is an inventory system with a drag&drop UI, skills learning, stats, level ups, map discovery (by default you cannot see the full game map), and a small minimap. Unfortunaly, it is just too big for me to spare some time and finish it while also working full-time, since just after this game I had my first developer job offers.","short_description":"First collab project idk","instructions":"Move with <kbd>W</kbd>,<kbd>A</kbd>,<kbd>S</kbd>,<kbd>D</kbd>, attack with <kbd>MOUSE_1</kbd> by clicking towards the direction of the cursor, drag and drop stuff in your inventory, kill slimes, find the exit, repeat.","thumbnail":"./thumbnail.png","start_url":"./index.html","width":"800","height":"600","links":[],"resources":["./rogue-dependencies.png"],"creation_date":"2021-11-07"}
