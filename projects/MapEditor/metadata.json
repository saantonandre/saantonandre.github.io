{"name":"Map Editor (for my engine)","short_name":"Map Editor","description":"This is what I use for generating my game maps. A similar editor I've found is 'Tiled' but it wasn't enough of a good fit for my engine/libraries. Among my favorite features it has a live gameplay button, which will open the game linked to the map editor and reflects every change you make to the map in real time (thanks to the shared context through 'window.parent'), it can import a tilesheet (which will replace the tiles representing numbers displayed at the bottom), movable panels through drag & drop, import/export capabilities, multi level editing and more.","short_description":"My personal Map Editor, I update it every time a new map-based game needs a map.","instructions":"No instructions, they would make sense in my development pipeline only. And in this instance, no game is connected to it, check out Astro Kittens: Map Editor, it has an older version but it is linked to the game.","thumbnail":"./thumbnail.png","start_url":"./index.html","width":"800","height":"600","links":[],"resources":[],"creation_date":"2021-04-22"}
